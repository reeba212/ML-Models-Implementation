# ML Models Implementation

This repository contains implementations of several machine learning models using Python. The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on approach for understanding the inner workings of these models.

The implemented models include:

* Linear Regression
* Decision Trees
* Gradient Descent
* Naive Bayes

Each implementation is provided as a separate Python file in this repository. The implementations use popular libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and visualization.

## Getting Started

To run the implementations, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You will also need to install the following libraries:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn

You can install these libraries using pip. For example, to install NumPy, you can run the following command:

```
pip install numpy
```
Once you have installed the required libraries, you can clone this repository to your local machine using Git. To do this, run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/reeba212/ML-Models-Implementation
```
To run the notebook, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:
```
jupyter notebook
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. From here, you can open the notebook and run the cells to train and test the model.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive set of implementations for several popular machine learning models. By studying these implementations, you can gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of these models and how they can be applied to real-world problems. With this knowledge, you can extend these implementations or use them as a starting point for your own projects.
